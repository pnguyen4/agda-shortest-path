- What was the starting point from last week
I was stuck on trying to get the indices of neighboring vertices for a given vertex in adjacency matrix.
This was the probably the most important feature missing.

- What was the goal from last week
Get unstuck.

- What was accomplished (i.e., starting point for next week)
neighbors function implemented with a few tests provided.

- Who worked on what
Everything was just me.

- What are you stuck on
Need to finish my algorithms.

- What is still left to do
1. Breadth-first search returns shortest path between two nodes in graph (path length measured by # of edges).
2. Dijkstra's algorithm (with all edge weights being equal) solution contains shortest path for starting node to every other node.
3. some shortness proofs
4-6. removed for time

- What is the goal for next week
Finish implementation of algorithms (already started)

- What is your fallback plan if you get stuck on something else unexpected
I found an alternative way to prove dijkstra's correctness, will probably go with that instead of original plan if
it ends up being easier.
